# Contributing to Chanterelle

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Quick Start

1. Read the developer guide: [README.dev.md](README.dev.md)
2. Get the app running locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

## What to Work On

- Roadmap: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- If you’re unsure where to start, pick a small, well-scoped item from the roadmap and open a PR.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused (one logical change).
- Include a short description of what changed and why.
- Prefer adding screenshots for UI changes.

## Before Submitting

- Run a local build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

- Make sure `pnpm tauri dev` still launches.

Thank you for contributing to Chanterelle! </3>
